It appears the push is failing because a previous commit, `5dd3831 chore: User requested push after local changes`, contains sensitive information (a GitHub Personal Access Token) hardcoded directly into the `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Even though we made subsequent commits to remove this information, GitHub's push protection scans the entire history of the branch you are pushing. As long as this commit exists in the history, GitHub will block the push.

To fully resolve this, the problematic commit needs to be removed from the Git history. This is typically done by rewriting history using `git rebase -i` or by reverting the entire commit. Rewriting Git history can be a complex and potentially risky operation, especially if others are collaborating on the same branch, as it requires a force push (`git push --force`).

**Here are your options:**

1.  **Cleanly Remove the Secret from History (Recommended for a true fix):**
    This involves rewriting your Git history. I can attempt to perform an interactive rebase to remove the commit `5dd3831`.
    *   **Warning:** Rewriting history can cause issues for collaborators if they have already pulled the old history. After rewriting, everyone working on this branch would need to re-clone the repository or perform a complex rebase themselves.
    *   If you choose this option, I will proceed with `git rebase -i` to remove the commit, and then you would need to perform a `git push --force` from your local machine to update the remote repository. **I cannot perform the `git push --force` for you.**

2.  **Temporarily Allow the Secret (Not Recommended for long-term security):**
    GitHub provides a URL to temporarily bypass push protection for a specific commit. The URL provided in the error message is:
    `https://github.com/jermicide/jeremyjr/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/36DDlDf8FXSKVh0iVOc8Y4DJj4A`
    *   You can visit this URL in your browser and follow the instructions to allow the secret to be pushed for that specific commit.
    *   **Caution:** This leaves the secret in your Git history, which is a security risk. Anyone with access to your repository's history (even cloned locally) could potentially find and exploit this token. This is a workaround, not a permanent solution.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed. If you choose option 1, confirm that you understand the implications of rewriting history and are prepared to force push.
