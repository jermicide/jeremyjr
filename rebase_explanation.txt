You have chosen to remove the problematic commit from the Git history. I will now perform an interactive rebase to remove commit `5dd3831`. Since I cannot use an interactive editor, I will use a script to automatically remove the commit from the rebase todo list.

After this operation is complete, the Git history will be rewritten, and you will need to perform a force push to update the remote repository. **I cannot perform the force push for you.**

Here is the command you will need to run after I am done:
`git push --force origin main`

I will now proceed with the rebase.
