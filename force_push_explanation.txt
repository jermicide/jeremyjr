I have successfully completed the rebase and rewritten the Git history to remove the commit containing the hardcoded secret.

The next and final step is to **force push** these changes to your GitHub repository. This will overwrite the history on the remote `main` branch with the new, clean history.

As I mentioned before, **I cannot perform the `git push --force` command for you.** This is a safety measure, as force pushing can have unintended consequences if not done carefully.

You now need to run the following command from your local terminal in the project directory:
`git push --force origin main`

After you run this command, your remote repository will be updated, and the "push declined due to repository rule violations" error will be resolved. You should then be able to run your Azure Pipeline successfully (provided the `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are correctly set as secret variables in your Azure DevOps project settings).
