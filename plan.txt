I understand you're still having trouble with the GitHub credentials in your pipeline. It seems like setting the secret variables in the Azure DevOps UI is not working as expected, and the pipeline keeps failing.

Let's try a different approach to get your pipeline to succeed. We can temporarily bypass the step that requires GitHub credentials.

Here's the plan:
1.  I will modify the `package.json` file to change the `build` script. I will remove the `npm run prebuild` part of the script.
2.  This will cause the pipeline to skip the step that tries to fetch live data from GitHub.
3.  The good news is that this should allow your pipeline to build the site successfully and avoid the "Bad credentials" error.
4.  The trade-off is that the site will be built using the sample data from `src/data/github.sample.json` instead of live data from your GitHub profile. This is a temporary measure to get you unstuck.

Once we have a successful pipeline run, we can then focus on troubleshooting the secret variable issue in a more targeted way if you still want to have live GitHub data on your site.

Would you like me to proceed with this plan?
